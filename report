Here is a summary of bug reports and actions:

Sat 10/9 - assertion violation reported by Garth
Mon 12/9 - several problems reported personally by students

	All of these problems fixed Mon 12/9

Tuesday 13/9 - Marolijn reported structure field alignment problem.

	This plus some other bugs fixed Wed 14/9. Synonyms and
	external synonyms implemented at Garth's request

Thursday 15/9 - segmentation violation reported by Garth. This 
	problem still remains, although it only occurs on casper, 
	not under DOS (checked with BoundsChecker), SunOS or FreeBSD.
	Under casper it affects the network (NFS timeouts)! I have been
	unable to fathom it, and eventually installed the compiler on
	ariel for Garth's use.

Friday 16/9 - `bug' reported by Annittah was a bug in her code.

Saturday 17/9 - Marolijn complains about problem assigning strings.
	This is simply due to string types not being implemented
	yet (this is mentioned in the docs)

Sunday 25/9 - Annittah reports a failed assertion. This was fixed on Tuesday
	but she was mailed with a workaround on Sunday.

	William reports that the channel table listing command
	doesn't print anything, but that setting channel delays and
	reliabilities does work. The table listing was broken when I
	implemented floating point types, and has since been fixed.

	William and Mark report that quitting from the interpreter
	before running the simulation results in a core dump. This
	has been fixed, and did not affect the students.

Monday 26/9 - Nigel reports an error then retracts.

With the exception of further messages from Garth, these are all the
complaints I have had. Hardly a `ton'. The only person who has had
real long-term problems to my knowledge has been Garth.
